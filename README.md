 ProjectEuler
==============

A place I keep the tools, answers, research and questions in regards to my journey through Project Euler.

 Tools
-------
Currently the only thing of interest here is the Javascript functionality meant to be added as an external resource on [JsFiddel](http://jsfiddle.net/) to make solving problems easier by pulling the question into the fiddle and providing a means of validating ones answer. Usage is simple, just include `http://potherca.github.io/ProjectEuler/euler-fiddle.js` as an external resource
