 ProjectEuler
==============

A place I keep the tools, answers, research and questions in regards to my journey through Project Euler.

 Tools
-------

Currently the only thing of interest here is the Javascript functionality meant to be added as 
an external resource on [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to make solving problems easier by pulling 
the question into the fiddle and providing a means of validating ones answer. 

Usage is simple, just include [`https://pother.ca/ProjectEuler/euler-fiddle.js`](https://pother.ca/ProjectEuler/euler-fiddle.js)
as an external resource and type the number of the puzzle you want to solve into the `HTML` pane.
